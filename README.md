# Foobar Server App

The Foobar Server App is a backend application that powers the Foobar social network. It follows the Model-View-Controller (MVC) architecture for better organization and separation of concerns. Below is an overview of the project structure:

## Project Structure

### Model

The Model directory contains MongoDB schemas and related methods for interacting with the database:

- **post.js**: Defines the schema for posts and includes methods for CRUD operations related to posts.
- **user.js**: Defines the schema for users and includes methods for CRUD operations related to users.
- **token.js**: Contains methods for managing authentication tokens.

### Controller

The Controller directory contains route handlers that process incoming HTTP requests and invoke corresponding methods from the Model:

- **post.js**: Handles HTTP requests related to posts, such as creating, updating, or deleting posts.
- **user.js**: Handles HTTP requests related to users, such as creating, updating, or deleting user accounts.
- **token.js**: Handles HTTP requests related to authentication and token management.

### Services

The Services directory contains business logic methods for handling user and post-related operations:

- **post.js**: Contains methods for performing business logic operations related to posts, such as fetching posts or managing post data.
- **user.js**: Contains methods for performing business logic operations related to users, such as authentication or user data management.

### Routes

The Routes directory contains Express.js route definitions for different API endpoints:

- **post.js**: Defines routes for handling HTTP requests related to posts.
- **user.js**: Defines routes for handling HTTP requests related to users.
- **token.js**: Defines routes for handling HTTP requests related to authentication and token management.

### No Viewer

As this is a backend server application, there is no Viewer directory. The application only returns JSON responses and does not render HTML views.

## MVC Architecture Benefits

- **Organization**: Separation of concerns into distinct directories makes the codebase easier to navigate and maintain.
- **Scalability**: The modular structure allows for easier scaling by adding new features or modifying existing ones.
- **Clarity**: The MVC architecture provides clear separation between different components, improving code readability and understanding.

---

With this project structure and adherence to the MVC architecture, the Foobar Server App aims to provide a robust and scalable backend foundation for the Foobar social network.

## Project Overview

Foobar Server App serves as the backend for the Foobar social network, handling user authentication, post management, and other backend functionalities.

## Features

- **User Authentication**: Handles user registration, login, and logout functionalities.
- **User Management**: Manages posts uploaded by users, including creation, editing, deletion, and retrieval.
- **Comment Management**: Handles comments on posts, allowing users to add, edit, delete, and retrieve comments.
- **Database Integration**: Integrates with a MongoDB database to store user data, posts, and comments.
- **RESTful API**: Provides a RESTful API for communication with the client-side application.


## How to Run the Server App

To run the server app locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:

```
git clone https://github.com/Eliaddr119/Foobar-Server.git
```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

```
cd foobar_server
```

3. Install dependencies:

```
npm install
```

4. Start the server:

```
node app.js
```

5. Open the site:

   the user have 2 options:
       1. go to the site http://localhost:8080/
       2. use the web react app -> go to https://github.com/Eliaddr119/foobar_part2_web and follow the instructions in the readme.
## Note

- Make sure you have MongoDB installed and running locally on port 27017.
- The server initializes the database with 25 posts and 4 users by default. The users are named "shlomi", "yael", "roni", and "evya". Shlomi is friends with all other users. The password for all users is "Zx123456789".
- Posts are ordered by date, with the newest posts appearing first.
- If you prefer not to add the default posts to the database, you can comment out the following code block in `app.js`:
```javascript
try {
    await User.insertMany(usersData);
    await Post.insertMany(postsData);
} catch (error) {
    console.log(error);
}
```
- Make sure you understand that you can run the web react app and the server or just run the server,
becuse we have th build of the web react app in the server you can just go to http://localhost:8080/


# Front-end components explained
Foobar is a cutting-edge social network designed to provide users with a seamless experience for connecting, sharing, and interacting online. Foobar is built using React for the frontend and is connected to a server for data storage and retrieval. Users can create profiles, make posts, comment on posts, and connect with other users. FooBar provides a fast and responsive social networking experience, making it easy for users to stay connected and share their thoughts and experiences with others.
If you would like to check the server code and run it check this following GitHub repository and follow the READEME file : https://github.com/Eliaddr119/Foobar-Server

## These following components form the FooBar platform, providing essential features for user authentication, post and comments uploading, and social interaction:
### SignUp üìù
